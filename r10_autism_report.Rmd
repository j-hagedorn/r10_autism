# Reading in Data

The data for these analyses is drawn from two primary sources: 

- *Service data* from the region's MIX EMR system and 
- *Waiver enrollment* reports generated from the MDHHS WSA system.

First, we read in the services data and process it for analysis.  Note that we are currently reading from .csv file output for this draft analysis.  A repeatable, automated process will rely on connection to database tables updated via an extract-transfer-load (ETL) process.  We also read in the waiver enrollment data from WSA.

```{r}
# Read in .csv files as dataframes
csv_path <- "C:/Users/joshh/OneDrive - TBD Solutions LLC/files/Region10/Autism/"
svs <- read_feather(paste0(csv_path,"svs.feather"))
# Read in .csv files as dataframes
wsa <- read_feather(paste0(csv_path,"wsa.feather"))
# If re-opened, client is given new 'Case ID' but Medicaid ID (i.e. 'ID') should be same

# Read in data related to authorized units
wsa_ipos <- read_feather(paste0(csv_path,"wsa_ipos.feather"))

```

# Eligible Autism Waiver Enrollees without a Plan of Service

As an initial summary, we look at the percent of persons who are enrolled in the autism waiver (i.e. `Status == "Open"`), but who do not have an Individualized Plan of Service (IPOS).

```{r}
wsa_tbl <-
wsa %>%
  filter(Status == "Open") %>%
  group_by(PIHP_CMH_Name) %>%
  summarize(
    without_IPOS = n() - sum(IPOSExists, na.rm = T),
    all = n()
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    pct = round(without_IPOS / all * 100, digits = 1)
  ) 

wsa_tbl %>%
  datatable(
    rownames = FALSE,
    colnames = c('CMHSP','Enrollees without IPOS','All Enrollees','Pct without IPOS'),
    caption = 'Percentage of Autism waiver enrollees without IPOS, by CMHSP',
    extensions = c('Responsive','Buttons'),
    options = list(
      dom = 't',
      buttons = c('colvis')
    )
  ) %>%
  formatStyle(
    'pct',
    background = styleColorBar(wsa_tbl$pct, 'grey'),
    backgroundSize = '100% 90%',
    backgroundRepeat = 'no-repeat',
    backgroundPosition = 'center'
  )
  
```

The following analyses will ask different questions for the groups represented here.  

- **Waitlist:** For individuals who do not have an IPOS and are not receiving Autism Waiver services, we will ask whether they receive interim services during their time on the waitlist.  
- **Receiving Services:** For individuals who are receiving autism waiver services, we will ask whether they are receiving services in the amount prescribed in their IPOS and whether their services are being conducted with the appropriate level of observation.

# Interim Services for Persons on Autism Waitlist

## Services per Enrollee on Waitlist

For each individual who is autism waiver eligible and on the waitlist, what non-ABA services are he/she receiving while they are waiting? At what frequency? 

```{r}
waitlist_svs <-
  wsa %>%
  # Filter individuals who are on waitlist

    Status == "Open"

## Summary of Services per Enrollee

The table below shows a summary of services received by each enrollee in the waiver who has been placed on the waitlist.^[]  It includes the following information:

- *Services provided:*  A list of services that the person has received
- *Days on waitlist:* The number of days between the enrollee's eligibility date and the most recent service date included in the services data extract (for any enrollee)
- *Days receiving services:*  The number of days between the earliest occurrence of any service following the person's eligibility date and the latest occurrence of any service
- *Percent days covered:* The percentage of the days that the person has been on the waitlist that are overlapped by the provision of services (i.e. `Days receiving services`/`Days on waitlist`)
- *Approximate hours:* The total number of hours of services received of any service that can be converted to a standard hour measurement.  This does not include units with the unit type of `Encounter` unless the time amount is specified in the service name.  It therefore *under*estimates the actual amount of services.
- *Contains waiver services:*  This field indicates whether, despite being marked as on the waiting list in WSA, the individual has claims which were submitted as autism waiver services.  If the row is colored red, this indicates that the status recorded in the WSA may require an update.

# Conformance with Prescribed Hours for ABA Services

For individuals who are receiving autism waiver services, what is the amount of services and does it match their plan?  The bar chart below shows the percentage of authorized hours of ABA that have been provided for each active autism waiver enrollee over the past 90 days.  Individuals whose services fall outside of the acceptable range (*i.e. <75% or >125%*) of the prescribed hours are differentiated by color.

# Required Observation of ABA Services

According to the Autism Waiver requirements, for every 10 hours of treatment provided (*including codes from the following:* `0364T`:`0367T`,`0372T`:`0374T`,`H2019`) to an individual client, there should be 1 hour of observation by a licensed practitioner(*including codes from the following:* `S5108`,`0368T`,`0369T`).  The table below shows the percentage of active autism waiver clients at each CMHSP who have received at least the required ratio of treatment to observation (10:1) during the most recent 90 days of available service data.  Individuals with fewer than 10 hours of treatment during this period are omitted from the calculations.  If an individual has not been receiving services for 90 days, the calculation applies to the portion of the interval when they have received services.
